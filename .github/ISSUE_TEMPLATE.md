Hi there :wave:! We've provided some issue templates for your convenience, but if they don't match what you need, feel free to start from scratch.

## Suggesting a New Feature

If you're interested in suggesting a new feature, please search for any existing
issues or pull requests first. If there isn't any available, use the issue
template below to kickoff a discussion about the feature:

```markdown
## Summary of Idea

<!--- Give a summary of what the idea is, in a paragraph or two. -->

## Initial Design

<!--- Images/wireframes/designs are super helpful for this! -->
<!--- Explain the change visually, give more context. -->

## Proposed Implementation

<!--- If you have an idea of the implementation needed, describe it here. -->

## References

<!--- Link to any existing ideas, references that might be useful for describing your idea.  -->
```

## Submitting a Bug Report

We're only providing support to developers/collaborators at the moment. In other words: if you've built Lona Studio in Xcode or attempted to generate code, feel free to report issues or ask for help. Otherwise, please wait for our official release -- we'll provide more designer-facing instructions and documentation as we get closer.

```markdown
## Expected Behavior

<!--- Tell us what should happen -->

## Current Behavior

<!--- Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior -->
```
